Fix balance calculation and cache invalidation issues

- Fix case-sensitive token name filter in BCH balance API
  * Change token__name='bch' to token__name__iexact='bch' in _get_bch_balance()
  * Ensures balance includes all BCH transactions regardless of token name casing

- Fix UTXOs being marked as spent=True initially
  * Explicitly set spent=False when creating new transactions without spending_txid
  * Prevents UTXOs from being incorrectly marked as spent on creation
  * Applied to both main creation path and IntegrityError handler

- Improve address balance cache invalidation
  * Invalidate address balance cache when new transactions are saved
  * Invalidate address balance cache when transactions are marked as spent
  * Update clear_cache_for_spent_transactions() to clear address cache
  * Update clear_transaction_cache() to clear address cache
  * Add cache clearing in get_bch_utxos() before marking transactions as spent
  * Ensures cached balances stay in sync with database changes

- Update transaction_post_save signal
  * Clear address balance cache on all transaction saves (not just new ones)
  * Handles both creation and spent status changes
